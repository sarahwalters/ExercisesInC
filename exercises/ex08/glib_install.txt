1. Download glib-2.50.3 from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.50/
2. Extract files from the tar
3. cd to the extracted directory and try to run ./configure
4. Install any dependency packages which are missing. For me:
   - sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libmount-dev libpcre3-dev
5. ./configure
6. make
7. make install
8. glib is installed in /usr/local/lib/glib-2.0
